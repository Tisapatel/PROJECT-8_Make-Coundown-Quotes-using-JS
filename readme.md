💻 How to Run
Extract the zip folder.

Open signin.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

Try incorrect login to see validation messages.

On successful entry, navigate to index.html.

The countdown and quotes will begin automatically.

📈 Future Enhancements
Store sign-in data using localStorage or integrate Firebase Auth

Fetch quotes from a public API (like Type.fit or Quotable)

Add dark mode toggle

Improve accessibility (keyboard nav, ARIA roles)

👨‍💻 Developer Notes
Ensure all image paths are correct relative to index.html

Use high-quality, compressed images to avoid slow load

Include fallback text for images using alt attributes

Responsive tested for screen sizes: 360px → 1920px+
